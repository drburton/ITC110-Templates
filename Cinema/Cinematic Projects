The included projects are only suggestions.  If you have an idea for a better class project, please share it in the Wiki!!

A few notes:
Projects should take advantage of available resources: Cameras, Green Screen, campus spaces, game engines, etc.
Do not suggest a project that requires the use of guns, violance, or anything that would be ACU inappropriate.
If won't show it to your grandmother, then don't propose the project.
